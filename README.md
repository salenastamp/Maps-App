# Maps-App
Maps App
This is a simple app using the Google Maps API. It allows the user to view a city and state on the map or generate a random location in North America.

In order to run the app, you will need a Google Maps API key that uses Maps Javascript API and Geocoding API. If you don't have one, you can generate one here: 
https://console.developers.google.com
Once you have the API key, you can enter it in application.properties.
